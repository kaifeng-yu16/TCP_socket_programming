# TCP_socket_programming
This is a project from duke ECE 650

This project developed a pair of programs that interact to model a game, which
is called "hot potato". 

This assignment provided hands-on practice
with creating a multi-process application, processing command line arguments, setting up and
monitoring network communication channels between the processes (using TCP sockets), and
reading/writing information between processes across sockets.
